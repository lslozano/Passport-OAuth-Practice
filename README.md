## Passport OAuth with Google Sign In

**Description:**

This is a personal practice project where I put into use Passport OAuth, Google Authentication, creation of users, protected roots and information only available to the respective user.

**Technologies used:**

 - Passport OAuth
 - Mongoose
 - Google OAuth
 - Express
 - Session
 - CRUD
 - Protected Routes

 **How to setup the project:**
 
1.- Clone or Download the files.
 
2.- Open them with the program you use to code.

3.- On terminal, position yourself in the folder where you saved the files.

4.- Execute npm i or npm install. If you are using yarn, it's yarn i or yarn install. This will install all the modules you need.

5.- You need to have mongo on your system. In another terminal window, run mongo to start the database.

6.- You need to setup your env variables accordingly. Those are yours to choose. The google callback url and secret are from your developer google site. The name of the database, port and secret are up to you.

7.- In the respective file of the project, run nodemon app.js and this will start the server on localhost.

8.- Go to the local host and start using the platform.
